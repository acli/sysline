 My my, are we in a hurry.  Ok, all set?

 0. in this example, let CC be the number of columns, RR the number of rows
    on you terminal, and rr be equal to RR-1
 1. run Configure and "make install" (compile for use of /etc/termcap)
 2. do "make.termcap-entry >file" (answer CC and RR respectively)
 3. add the entries in file to /etc/termcap (replace "con-unk" as necessary)
 4. do "stty rows rr" on the vt where you want to run sysline
 5. do "TERM=con80xRR-s" (bash, zsh) or "set term=con80xRR-s" (csh) on that vt
 6. do "sysline +10" on that vt
 7. check if the status-line isn't messed with, do "ls -la", "less <something>", etc.
 8. all's well? do: mail -s "we did it - stop - description follows" `whoami` <QuickStart
 9. still here? there's the README (be sure to skip section 2 this time :),
    a man-page, the sources, maybe a newsgroup?
