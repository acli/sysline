 changelog for sysline (Linux)
 -----------------------------

* v 0.0	May 11th 1994	bjdouma@xs4all.hacktic.nl (Bauke Jan Douma)
	- Tue May 10 14:49:44 MET DST 1994: ported to Linux, also
	  corrected some bugs:
	- `arrows' pointed to garbage with TERMINFO
	- with -e option, changing `columns' produced a segfault with TERMINFO
	- missing check for `status_line_esc_ok' in stringdump() with TERMINFO
	- missing check for `width_status_line' in getwinsize() with TERMINFO
	- "Mail has just arrived..." lacked a leading stringspace() call

  this initial port to Linux didn't have a version number, neither did the
  patch I released soon afterwards to stop a memory leak... (sysline.patch1.gz)
  
* v 0.2	May 19th 1994	bjdouma@xs4all.hacktic.nl (Bauke Jan Douma)
  'major' changes, so new release, calling it version 0.2, file is
  called sysline-0.2.tar.gz.
  changes included:
	- fixed SIGWINCH stuff when using -w flag; I suppose it works,
	  check it out under X, in a 1-line window, that you change in
	  hor. size with the mouse.  
	- fixed (hopefully) utmp stuff
	- fixed stringprt(); now change of loadavg in last 5min is shown 
	  correctly.
	- customized/simplified take_snapshot code and put it in 
	  readproctab.c. this remains basically the code from Michael 
	  Johnson's procps package, I hope I'm not doing anything 
	  unethical here.
	- added i2/is2 and ce/el strings and changed ts/tsl strings for 
	  termcap/terminfo files; you prob. want to change these.

* v 0.3	May 26th 1994	bjdouma@xs4all.hacktic.nl (Bauke Jan Douma)
  changes included:
  	- a fix in readproctab.c so sysline won't refuse to run when
  	  there are no processes running (actually it quietly died due
  	  to a SEGV after following a NULL pointer).
  	- correctly show high priority processes as running.
	- fix to handle window (-w flag) correctly under X.
  	
* v 0.4	Jun  4th 1994	bjdouma@xs4all.hacktic.nl (Bauke Jan Douma)
  changes included:
  	- simplified reading of process table, prob. making it slightly faster.
	- get bell from termcap/terminfo file

* v 0.5	Jun 16th 1994	bjdouma@xs4all.hacktic.nl (Bauke Jan Douma)
  changes included:
	- changed signal to linux sigaction.
	- add'l fixes to utmp stuff
  	- added \Em to ts/tsl strings
  	- added cls utility as a bonus.
  	- changed cs utility somewhat.
  	- <drum roll> added -Wall to CFLAGS ;)
	- another slight speedup of process table reading
	- enabled use of standard curses
	- put customizable defines in config.h

* v 0.6	Aug 30th 1994	bjdouma@xs4all.hacktic.nl (Bauke Jan Douma)
  changes included:
  	- added compile option to suffix ~/.who, ~/.sysline and 
  	  ~/.syslinelock files with ttyname, as in ".who.tty1"

* v 0.7	Mar  9th 1995	bjdouma@xs4all.nl (Bauke Jan Douma)
	- minor cosmetic changes in sysline.c
	- quick 'n dirty Configure utility

* v 0.8	Apr 20th 1995	bjdouma@xs4all.nl (Bauke Jan Douma)
	- added checks of return values in readproctab()
	- doubled size of terminal buffer (2048)
	- reordering and re-layout of and addenda and corrections to man-page
	- reworked README (more hints, examples of modified capabilities)
	- scripts to create termcap/terminfo referring entries
	- status-line colorization

* v 0.9	Apr 23th 1995	bjdouma@xs4all.nl (Bauke Jan Douma)
	- exterminated lurking bug with user logging (clear extension
	  of reallocated utmp buffer)
	- let (gnu) tgetent allocate storage for termcap entry
	- more changes to man-page
	- more additions to README
	- made lsm conform to new specs
	- corrected errors in `make.terminfo-entry' script: 'tsl' string
	  needed a %p1 code and and 'tc=' should have been 'use='
	  (apparently you could also use ncurses' captoinfo utility
	  to convert the termcap entry to a terminfo entry)
	- expanded make.termcap-entry and make.terminfo-entry scripts
	  with an entry for a status-line on the top of the screen
	  and in light of this modified the cs and cls utilities (the
	  old version of the latter is still present as cls.btm,
	  while I also added its counterpart, cls.top; both will
	  prob. disappear some future version)

* v 1.0	May 11th 1995	bjdouma@xs4all.nl (Bauke Jan Douma)
	- changes in entries generated by make.term*-entry scripts.
	- also let (gnu) tgetstr allocate storage for cap. strings
	- simplified README
	- got rid of cls script; `tput clear' will do the job;
	  there are tput versions both for terminfo and termcap.
	- enabled use of tput in `cs' script
	- apparently 'i2'/'is2' are widely used, so move them definitively
	  back into termcap/terminfo entry, making the `cs' script as
	  such redundant (though you must still do `stty rows nn');
	  keep `cs' around though, might be handy to reset the
	  terminal to its old size after having killed sysline
	- independent colorization of reversed and normal status-line
	  (as a consequence, the env. var. SYSLINE_COLOR has become
	  plural: SYSLINE_COLORS, and its format has changed )

* v 1.1	Mar 13th 1996	bjdouma@xs4all.nl
	- macrofied unctrl (obviating the need for BSD curses)
	- changes in Configure utility and Makefile
	- choice between ELF and aout in Configure
	- make it compile, basically :^)
	- sliced QuickStart off of README
	- changes in the README
	- bells and whistles
